                div.instructionsSection VR Scribble is a web based Virtual Reality multiplayer scribbling app. It makes use of just two phones, to serve as the VR display, and controller. A headset like the Gear VR to mount one of the phones into is required, though there are plenty of cheap alternatives like Google's Cardboard which also work.

                    p A room system is used to keep everyone together, and user profiles are used to identify everyone and their controllers.
